A Python command-line based Yathzee game.

Here are the rules:

    - You play against the computer
    - The game works by turns. For each turn you have five dice and the right to roll them max three times.
    - The goal is to reach a certain set of dice numbers : twos, sixes, three of a kind, four of a kind, etc. Each set makes you win a certain amount of points.
    - When both you and the computer did every set, both count their total points. The one with the best score wins.
